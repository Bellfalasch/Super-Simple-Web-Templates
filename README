********************************************
* 3 basic templates - extremly VERY basic! *
********************************************

HTML:
Only simple html and css to get started with setup of a simple web site. Ideal for web campaigns or other single page sites.

PHP:
Basically extending the HTML-template with some basic php-functionality. It uses a simple header and footer-system, as well as more "advanced"
foldering. This template is used for bigger sites where you would have multiple pages. The use of folder and file names are entirely to my
own personal taste ^_^

WORDPRESS:
Originally for WP 3.0 but extended a bit. It works for WP 3.3.1. This code is full of beautiful weirdness, but it is the code I always use
when it's time for me to set up yet another WP-theme somewhere. It's scaled down a lot, but still uses as much of WP as possible.

EXTRA:
In the root you'll find a bunch of often used php-functions I tend to use in many projects. Each file is a function.
